<!--onchange	An HTML element has been changed
onclick	The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown	The user pushes a keyboard key
onload	The browser has finished loading the page

Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions:

Things that should be done every time a page loads
Things that should be done when the page is closed
Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
Content that should be verified when a user inputs data

Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
