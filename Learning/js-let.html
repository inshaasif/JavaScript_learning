    <!--The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables declared with let have Block Scope

Variables declared with let must be Declared before use

Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope-->

<!--Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.-->

<h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using var</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var  x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{  
var x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 2
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script

What is Good?
let and const have block scope.

let and const can not be redeclared.

let and const must be declared before use.

let and const does not bind to this.

let and const are not hoisted.

<h2>JavaScript let</h2>

<p>Redeclaring a variable with <b>let</b>, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x = 2;   // Allowed

{
  let x = 3;   // Allowed
}

{
  let x = 4;   // Allowed
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!--Let Hoisting-->
<h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>

<p>With <b>var</b>, you can use a variable before it is declared:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
carName = "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
var carName;
</script>
